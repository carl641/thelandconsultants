            What is a land survey?

          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>A land survey is a professional examination and measurement of a property to determine its boundaries, features, and physical characteristics. Using specialized equipment such as GPS receivers, robotic total stations, and drone-mounted LiDAR, a licensed surveyor establishes legal property lines, locates improvements, identifies easements, and creates detailed maps. These documents are used for real estate transactions, construction planning, permitting, and resolving property disputes.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>There are many situations where a survey is necessary or strongly recommended. Common reasons include: buying or selling property, building a new structure or addition, installing a fence, resolving a disagreement about property lines with a neighbor, subdividing land into smaller parcels, refinancing a mortgage when the lender requires it, determining if you are in a flood zone, and evaluating a property&rsquo;s development potential. A good guideline is that if the work you are planning requires a building permit, a survey is likely needed.</p>

          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>Only a licensed Professional Land Surveyor (PLS) can legally perform a land survey and create or modify property boundaries and easements. Surveyors must hold a valid license in the state where the property is located. The Land Consultants holds professional surveying licenses across Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Kentucky, North Carolina, and Florida.</p>

            <span class="faq-item__icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>The survey process generally follows four stages. First, we discuss your project needs and provide a quote. Second, we perform research by reviewing deeds, plats, and courthouse records to understand the property&rsquo;s legal history. Third, our field crew visits the property to collect measurements using precision equipment. Fourth, we process the data in the office and prepare your deliverables &mdash; typically a survey plat, map, or report depending on the type of survey. You receive the completed documents ready for your intended use.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>The timeline varies depending on the type and complexity of the survey. A straightforward residential lot survey may be completed more quickly than a large rural boundary survey or a commercial ALTA survey that requires coordination with title companies. Factors that affect timeline include property size, terrain, vegetation, the quality of existing records, and current workload. We provide estimated timelines when we quote each project and communicate proactively if anything changes.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>You do not need to be present during the field survey. Our crews are experienced professionals who can conduct the work independently. However, we do need access to the property, so if there are locked gates or other access restrictions, we will coordinate with you in advance. If you wish to be present, you are welcome to meet the crew on site.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>Providing any documents you have can help the survey proceed more efficiently. Useful items include your property deed, any previous survey plats, title insurance commitments (required for ALTA surveys), site plans, and any correspondence related to boundary agreements or disputes. If you do not have these documents, we can obtain most of what we need through courthouse and public records research.</p>

            <span class="faq-item__icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>Survey costs vary significantly based on the type of survey needed, the size and complexity of the property, terrain and vegetation conditions, the availability of existing records, and the project timeline. A small residential lot survey will cost less than a large boundary survey on a rural tract with challenging terrain, and ALTA surveys for commercial properties are more involved than standard boundary surveys. We provide individual quotes after evaluating the specifics of your project. We recommend choosing a surveyor based on experience and reputation rather than price alone.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <button class="faq-item__question" onclick="this.parentElement.classList.toggle('active')">

            <span class="faq-item__icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>No two properties are identical. Factors that drive cost include: <strong>Size</strong> &mdash; larger properties require more fieldwork. <strong>Terrain</strong> &mdash; steep, rocky, or heavily wooded sites take longer to traverse. <strong>Records quality</strong> &mdash; properties with vague or poorly written deeds require more research. <strong>Survey type</strong> &mdash; an ALTA survey has more requirements than a basic boundary survey. <strong>Season</strong> &mdash; dense summer vegetation can slow field work. <strong>Deadline</strong> &mdash; expedited timelines may require schedule adjustments.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>The person who requests the survey is generally responsible for payment. In a real estate transaction, the cost may be assigned to the buyer, seller, or split between both parties depending on the terms of the purchase agreement. There is no universal rule &mdash; it is a negotiable item in the transaction.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>A lot survey (also called a mortgage or closing survey) is typically done for properties in recorded subdivisions, often at the request of a lender or title company prior to closing. It verifies the property matches what is being represented and shows improvements relative to property lines. A full boundary survey is more comprehensive &mdash; it involves extensive research, physically establishes and monuments property corners, and provides a higher level of certainty about boundary positions. A lot survey should not be relied upon to establish fence lines or resolve disputes.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>ALTA/NSPS surveys are typically required for commercial real estate transactions, especially when a title company or out-of-state lender is involved. They follow a nationally recognized standard and include more detailed information about easements, zoning, improvements, and flood zones than a standard boundary survey. If your lender, title company, or attorney requests an ALTA survey, that is what you need. For most residential transactions, a standard boundary or lot survey is sufficient.</p>

            <p>For a new home construction, you may need several types of surveys at different stages. Before construction: a boundary survey to confirm property lines and a topographic survey if the site has significant grade changes. During construction: a construction layout to stake the building location. After construction: an as-built survey or mortgage survey for the lender. Your builder, architect, or local building department can advise on the specific requirements for your jurisdiction.</p>

          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>You need a <a href="services/topographic-surveys.html">topographic survey</a>. This type of survey measures elevations across your property and presents them as contour lines on a map. It also locates existing features like buildings, trees, and drainage. Topographic surveys are commonly requested by architects and engineers before designing a building project, grading plan, or site development.</p>

          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>If you need an official determination of your structure&rsquo;s elevation relative to the flood zone, you need an Elevation Certificate. This is a specific FEMA form completed by a licensed surveyor that documents the elevation of your building compared to the base flood elevation for your area. It is used to obtain or reduce flood insurance premiums, or to demonstrate that your property is outside the flood hazard area. Contact us and we can evaluate your situation.</p>

This factual determination is often enough to resolve informal disputes. If the disagreement escalates to a legal matter, only the courts can make binding ownership determinations, but the survey serves as key evidence in those proceedings.</p>

            What is an encroachment?

          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>An encroachment occurs when a structure, fence, driveway, or other improvement crosses a property boundary and occupies a portion of an adjacent property. Encroachments can also occur into easement areas. A survey identifies encroachments by establishing the exact property lines and locating all improvements relative to those lines. Knowing about encroachments before purchasing a property helps you make an informed decision and negotiate appropriately.</p>

            What is an easement?

          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>An easement is a legal right for someone other than the property owner to use a portion of the property for a specific purpose. Common examples include utility easements (allowing power, water, or sewer lines to cross your property), drainage easements, and access easements (allowing a neighbor to cross your property to reach theirs). Easements are typically recorded in the county deed records and are identified and shown on survey plats.</p>

            Can I use an old survey instead of getting a new one?
            <span class="faq-item__icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>It depends on the purpose and the age of the survey. For a real estate closing, most lenders require a current survey. Old surveys may not reflect changes that have occurred on the property such as new buildings, fences, or changes in adjacent properties. They also may not meet current survey standards. However, an existing survey can be useful reference material and may reduce the cost of a new survey since some of the research has already been done.</p>

            How do I find my property corners?
            <span class="faq-item__icon">+</span>
          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>Property corners are typically marked with iron pins, pipes, or concrete monuments set in the ground. Over time, these markers can become buried, overgrown, or disturbed. If you have an existing survey plat, it may show distances and bearings that help locate the corners. However, accurately locating property corners requires professional surveying equipment and expertise. If you need to know exactly where your corners are, a licensed surveyor can locate them and reset any that have been disturbed.</p>
