        <h2>What Does a Land Surveyor Do in Chattanooga?</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="location-content-block">
        <p>A land surveyor measures and maps the physical features of a property to establish legal boundaries, determine elevations, and identify easements or encroachments. In Chattanooga, this work is especially important due to the area&rsquo;s varied terrain&mdash;from the steep ridges of Lookout Mountain and Signal Mountain to the low-lying areas along the Tennessee River and Chickamauga Creek.</p>
        <p>Hamilton County&rsquo;s property records include older plats and deeds that sometimes reference natural landmarks or outdated measurement systems. A licensed surveyor interprets these records, reconciles them with modern GPS and total station data, and produces a clear, legally defensible survey plat. Whether you&rsquo;re purchasing a home, splitting a parcel, building a new structure, or refinancing a mortgage, a <a href="../services/boundary-surveys.html">professional land survey</a> provides the factual foundation you need to make informed decisions and avoid costly disputes.</p>
        <p>At The Land Consultants, every survey we deliver in the Chattanooga area is prepared and certified by a <a href="../about.html">Tennessee-licensed Professional Land Surveyor</a>, backed by nearly three decades of regional experience.</p>

          <h3>Boundary Surveys in Chattanooga</h3>
          <p>A <a href="../services/boundary-surveys.html">boundary survey</a> establishes the exact legal limits of your property by locating monuments, corners, and boundary lines described in your deed. In Chattanooga, boundary surveys are commonly needed for real estate closings, fence installations, property line disputes, and building permit applications. Our crew locates existing markers and sets new iron pins when needed, then delivers a recorded plat that clearly shows your property lines relative to improvements, easements, and adjacent parcels throughout Hamilton County.</p>

          <h3>ALTA/NSPS Surveys in Hamilton County</h3>
          <p>An <a href="../services/alta-surveys.html">ALTA/NSPS survey</a> meets the national standards required for commercial real estate transactions and title insurance. It includes boundary lines, easements, rights-of-way, encroachments, improvements, and other details specified by your lender or title company. We prepare ALTA surveys for commercial properties throughout Chattanooga&rsquo;s business districts, including downtown, the Southside, East Brainerd, and the growing Hamilton Place corridor. Each survey is tailored to the specific Table A items your transaction requires.</p>

          <h3>Topographic Surveys</h3>
          <p>A <a href="../services/topographic-surveys.html">topographic survey</a> maps the elevation, contours, and physical features of a site&mdash;including trees, utilities, drainage, and existing structures. This data is critical for architects, engineers, and developers designing projects on Chattanooga&rsquo;s hilly terrain. From Missionary Ridge to the ridges above the North Shore, topographic surveys help ensure proper grading, drainage planning, and regulatory compliance for construction projects of all sizes.</p>

          <h3>Construction Staking</h3>
          <p><a href="../services/construction-layout.html">Construction staking</a> translates building plans from paper to the ground. Our survey crew places precise stakes and markers to guide contractors during grading, foundation work, utility installation, and road layout. We support residential subdivisions, commercial builds, and infrastructure projects throughout the Chattanooga metro area, providing the accuracy needed to keep your project on schedule and within specifications.</p>

          <h3>Drone/UAS Surveys</h3>
          <p><a href="../services/drone-uav-surveys.html">Drone and UAS surveys</a> capture high-resolution aerial imagery and LiDAR data for large tracts, difficult terrain, and sites where traditional surveying is impractical. We use FAA-certified drone technology to produce orthomosaic maps, 3D surface models, and volumetric calculations for mining, construction monitoring, and land development projects throughout the Tennessee Valley. Drone surveys are especially effective in Chattanooga&rsquo;s rugged mountain terrain and heavily wooded properties.</p>

          <h3>Flood Elevation Certificates</h3>
          <p>An Elevation Certificate documents the elevation of a structure relative to the Base Flood Elevation (BFE) established by FEMA. Properties near the Tennessee River, Chickamauga Creek, and other waterways in Hamilton County may be located in or near a flood zone. We prepare elevation certificates that help property owners determine flood insurance requirements, apply for LOMA/LOMR letters, or verify compliance with local floodplain regulations in the Chattanooga area.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>Survey costs in Chattanooga depend on the type of survey, property size, terrain, vegetation, and the availability of existing records at the Hamilton County Register of Deeds. Hilly properties on Lookout Mountain or Signal Mountain may require additional fieldwork compared to a flat lot in East Brainerd.

            <p>Most residential boundary surveys in Hamilton County are completed within one to two weeks from the date of authorization, depending on property size, terrain, and the extent of record research required. ALTA/NSPS surveys and larger commercial projects may require additional time. We provide estimated timelines at the time of your quote so you can plan accordingly.</p>

            <p>A <a href="../services/boundary-surveys.html">boundary survey</a> focuses on locating and marking your property&rsquo;s legal boundary lines and corners. An <a href="../services/alta-surveys.html">ALTA/NSPS survey</a> meets stricter national standards and includes additional details&mdash;such as easements, encroachments, improvements, and utilities&mdash;required for commercial transactions and title insurance. Your lender or title company typically determines which survey type is needed for your transaction.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="faq-item__answer">
            <p>A boundary survey is strongly recommended before building a fence, adding a deck or room, or constructing any structure near your property line. Hamilton County and the City of Chattanooga may require a current survey for building permits, especially in areas with setback requirements. A survey ensures you build on your own property and avoid costly encroachment disputes with neighbors.</p>
